## FAQS:
> Why should I use this? if top or htop already exists ?
You really shouldn't, this is my final project (which is more of a proof-of-concept) for my HWMAD class.
> Is this program a security risk considering that it needs an HTML page hosted ?
This is meant to be used on a local network, feel free to set up SSL if you want it to be web-facing. I would recommend you make a passowrd system first though.
> What grade did you get on this project?
Hopefully a good one !
